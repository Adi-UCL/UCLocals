Porticode 5.0 Project

1. Backend
This operates using a MariaDB database administrated via PHPMyAdmin. An SQL dump file is included to help set up the sample student data on your localhost. In order to manage web requests that need to query the database, Python was used with Flask. The Python implements the logic to query the database with searches, insertions, and updates, while using Flask enables the Python code to be executed through web requests. The intention is that the frontend (once developed beyond a prototype) will be able to utilize the Python-based web request API.
